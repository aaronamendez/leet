/*
a number of students are taking a test

seated in one row

each student is of potentially different skill level (integer)

we can assign tests of various difficulties (integer, 1 = lowest)

assign a test to each student, such that:

1. if student A (higher skill level) is sitting next to student B (lower skill level), then A should get a higher difficulty test
2. all students should get the lowest difficulty test possible

skills [10 15 20 5] => [1 2 3 1]
